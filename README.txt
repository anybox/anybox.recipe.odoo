anybox.recipe.openerp
=====================

.. contents::

This is a buildout recipe to download, install and configure OpenERP server,
web client and gtk client. It currently supports versions 6.0 and 6.1 and
custom branches. You get 3 recipes at once. The recipe to use is the following:

 - For the server: recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:server
 - For the web client: recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:webclient
 - For the gtk client: recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:gtkclient

Recipe options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zc.recipe.egg options
---------------------

This recipe reuses the *zc.recipe.egg* recipe, so the options are the same
(*eggs*, *interpreter*, etc.)
Consult the documentation here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg/1.3.2

specific options
----------------

It also adds a few specific options :

 * **version**: specify one of:
   * the version number of an official OpenERP (server, web client or gtk client)
   * a custom download: `url http://example.com/openerp.tar.gz`
   * an absolute or a relative path: `path /my/path/to/a/custom/openerp`
   * the url of a custom bzr/hg/git/svn branch or repository. See *addons* below.
   The download area for official versions and custom downloads can be
   specified in the **openerp-downloads-directory** of the
   ``[buildout]`` section. Like all paths, if not absolute, it will be
   interpretated relatively to the buildout directory. By setting it in your
   ``default.cfg``, you may share the downloads among different
   buildouts.

 * **addons**: specify additional addons, either a path or a repository.
 * **script_name**: specify the name of the startup script to generate

For the *version* and *addons* option, if you use a remote repository the syntax is::

  type url directory revision

where:
 * `type` can be bzr, hg, git or svn
 * `url` is any URL supported by the versionning tool
 * `directory` is the local directory that will be created
 * `revision` is any version specification supported


Official version
----------------

To use an official OpenERP version, just specify the version. For instance with the webclient::

    [webclient]
    recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:webclient
    version = 6.0.3

Note: with OpenERP 6.1 the web client is natively included in the server as a simple module. In that case you don't need to write a separate part for the web client, unless that's what you really want to do.

Custom or development version
-----------------------------

If you want to use your own custom branch at revision 4751::

    [webclient]
    recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:webclient
    version = bzr https://code.launchpad.net/~anybox/openobject-client-web/6.0-bug-906449 webclient-debug 4751

If you don't specify the revision, it will use the latest revision of
the branch.
The branch will be updated at each buildout run.


Custom addons
-------------

The `addons` option has a specific behaviour. You can use it to specify
additional OpenERP addons, either a relative or absolute path or
a specification for a version control system (VCS).

The first word of the value specifies the retrieval type (either
``local`` or a VCS short name). In the ``local`` case, the remainings
of the value is the path on the filesystem (relative to the buildout
directory or absolute).

In VCS cases, the syntax is uniformly::

  VCS_TYPE SOURCE_URL DESTINATION REVISION

Of these, URL and REVISION are interpreted by the prescribed VCS
system, while DESTINATION is an absolute path on the
filesystem, or relative to the buildout dir.

The currently supported VCS types are bzr,hg,git and svn.

Example::

  addons = local ../some/relative/path/for/custom_addons/
           local /some/other/absolute/path/for/custom_addons
           bzr lp:openobject-addons/trunk/    addons0 last:1
           hg  http://example.com/some_addons addons1 tip
           git http://example.com/some_addons addons2 master
           svn http://example.com/some_addons addons3 head

VCS sources are updated on each build according to the specified
revision. You have to be careful with the revision specification.

Buildout offline mode is supported. In that case, update to the
prescibed revision is performed, if the VCS allows it (Subversion does not).

OpenERP options
---------------
The OpenERP configuration files are generated by OpenERP itself in the buildout
`etc` directory during the first buildout run.  You can overwrite options in
these config files in the recipe section of your buildout.cfg.  The options
must be written using a dotted notation prefixed with the name of the section.
The specified options will just overwrite the existing options in the
corresponding config files. You don't have to replicate all the options in your
buildout.cfg.  If an option or a section does not exist in the openerp config
file, it can be created from there.

For example you can specify the xmlrpc port for the server or
even an additional option that does not exist in the default config file::

  options.xmlrpc_port = 8069
  options.additional_option = "foobar"

It will end-up in the server config as::

  [options]
  xmlrpc_port = 8069
  additional_option = "foobar"

For the web client you can specify the company url with::

  global.server.socket_port = 8080
  openerp-web.company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'

It will modify the corresponding web client config::

  [global]
  server.socket_port = 8080

  [openerp-web]
  company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'

Generated startup scripts
-------------------------

Startup scripts are created in the `bin` directory. By default the name is:
start_<part_name>, so you can have several startup scripts for each part if you
configure several OpenERP servers or clients. You can pass additional typical
arguments to the server via the startup script, such as -i or -u options.
You can choose another name for the script by using the *script_name* option.


Example OpenERP 6.0 buildout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a sample buildout with versions specification, 2 OpenERP servers (with
one using the latest 6.0 branch on the launchpad) using only NETRPC and
listening on 2 different ports, and 2 web clients::

    [buildout]
    parts = openerp1 web1 openerp2 web2
