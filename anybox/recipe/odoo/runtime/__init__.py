=======

This subpackage provides encapsulations and entry points for the application
itself:

* the ``session`` module features the supporting objects for "Odoo scripts"
  and the dedicated python interpreter.
* the ``start_openerp`` and ``test_openerp`` modules are the entry points for
  the main startup scripts.

This architecture is meant in particular to provide stability and uniformity
accross Odoo major versions, so that the recipe can be leveraged by
automated deploymnent tools and continuous integration systems.
